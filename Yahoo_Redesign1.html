  		 What does a humanist history of the Internet look like? Though it isn’t a documentary in the journalistic sense, Werner Herzog’s Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World paints a unique picture of the bones and skin of our technologically interconnected universe.

I’ve seen and read countless documentaries and histories of the Internet’s creation and proliferation, but that didn’t stop Lo and Behold from feeling fresh, with a clear but curious perspective that had me looking at familiar events and listening to people well known to me with a different level of intensity.

The film, which is debuting at the Sundance film festival this weekend, is presented by Netscout, a firm that specializes in network monitoring. Netscout’s Jim McNiel, who executive produces here, saw Herzog’s texting and driving doc From One Second To The Next and thought that he could perhaps examine the infrastructure and underpinnings of the web, exposing questions of reliability and, yes, likely crafting some nice synergy for Netscout’s core business.

When we spoke about the movie, Herzog was incredibly clear to me that he is not a journalist. Indeed, he frequently interacts with the subjects, asking them viewpoint questions designed to provoke a reaction.werner_1

The choice of ‘nodes’ to focus on was an interesting one. Herzog speaks to Silicon Valley luminaries like roboticist and Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun and Elon Musk (whose fears about the future of Artificial Intelligence make an appearance), but he also talks to pioneers like Ted Nelson, whose Xanadu concept would have created a far different Web than the one we know today — many argue a more stable and sustainable one as well. To a creator and Internet worker, Nelson’s ideas about more durable linking that allowed you to always see the source material for a cited passage and to follow its provenance always felt like a missed opportunity to me.

Herzog certainly seems to feel a connection in the segment with Nelson. He tells me that Nelson was a filmmaker when he was younger, which led to a common language.

The film bounces around, with connections between topics that feel more fibrous than a well-ordered shot list. Indeed, Herzog says that he let himself be led from topic to topic by his discussions with subjects. Some of those connections are surprising to Herzog, as well. It’s not called out in the film, but an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium displays tattoos derived from Herzog’s seminal documentary Cave of Forgotten Dreams. The experience of following a strange hyperlink to a familiar destination made physical.
